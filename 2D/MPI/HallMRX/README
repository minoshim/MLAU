--- Hall Magnetic reconnection with MLAU two-dimensional code (MPI version) ------
 Resistive diffusion (magnetic field), viscous diffusion (velocity field), and anisotropic thermal condution (Temperature)  are included.
 Hall effect is included.
 Diffusion coefficients are treated as uniform.
 To activate these solvers, set DIFF and HALL being 1 and tune eta0, nu0, kk0, and iner_p in global.hpp
