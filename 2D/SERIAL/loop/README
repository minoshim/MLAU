Comment:
 Magnetic field Bx and By are initialized by numerically discretizing the vector potential Az, and they should satisfy divB=0 in a disretized form.
 When the spatial order is 2nd (ODR = 2 in mhd_fd_ct_2d.c), 2nd-order discretization of Az is sufficient.
 When the spatial order is 4th (ODR = 4), it is recommended to initialize Bx and By via lines 72-81 in init.hpp.
